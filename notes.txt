Simplifying runtime: 
1st, drop constants
2nd, drop non-dominants

----------
- Constant = O(1)
- logarithmic time (O(log n)):
2^3 == 8, so: Log_2 3 = 8
same as saying, 2, to the what power, equals 8?
Or how many times do you need to divide 8 by 2 to get down to one item.
- linear = O(n)
-- log-linear or quasi-linear: O(nlog n)
- quadratic time = O(n^2)

BRUTE FORCE:
exponential time = O(k^n)
Factorial time = O(!n)

--------
Different terms for inputs:
GOTCHA concept!
It means you must use different variables for different input sizes in a complexity formula when they’re independent.

Example: 
def myfunc(a,b):
    for i in range(a):
        print(i)
    for j in range(b):
        print(j)
Cannot simplify to O(n), beacause we have 2 inputs that could = n.
So instead of forcing everything into one n, you write things like O(n + m) or O(V + E) to show which part of the input each term depends on.

Greater concept:
This is a simplified way of saying that each part of a program, inside and outside of a function should be evaluated separated, and then combined to get the runtime (depending on the the execution path).


FOR INTERVIEWS: you must be able to recite space and time complexity for algos and data structures!!!!! FLASHCARDS?!?!?!
